# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed All Emojis
- Removed emojis from `Home.jsx`
- Removed emojis from `Jobs.jsx`
- Removed emojis from `Scraper.jsx`
- Replaced emoji indicators with text (e.g., "Location:" instead of location pin emoji)

### 2. Implemented User Authentication System

#### Backend Changes:
- Created `backend/app/api/auth.py` with login/signup endpoints
- Added JWT token authentication using `python-jose`
- Integrated auth router in `main.py`
- Used existing User model from `models.py`
- Password hashing with bcrypt via passlib

#### Frontend Changes:
- Created `Login.jsx` page with email/password form
- Created `Signup.jsx` page with user registration
- Updated `App.jsx` to include:
  - Protected routes requiring authentication
  - Navigation that shows/hides based on login status
  - User info and logout button in navbar
- Added comprehensive auth CSS styling in `index.css`

### 3. User Data Integration
- Updated all pages to use logged-in user ID from localStorage:
  - `Home.jsx` - checks user profile
  - `Profile.jsx` - saves/loads user profile data
  - `Jobs.jsx` - uses user ID for applications
  - `Dashboard.jsx` - displays user-specific stats
- Removed hardcoded `USER_ID = 1` throughout the application

### 4. Database Structure
The existing database already had:
- `users` table with email, password, full_name
- `user_profiles` table with comprehensive user information
- `jobs` table for scraped jobs
- `job_applications` table linking users to jobs

### 5. Scraper Analysis
- The Indeed scraper uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4`
- No external API required - scrapes directly from Indeed website
- Dependencies already in `requirements.txt`
- **Note**: Web scraping may break if Indeed changes their HTML structure
- Alternative: Consider using job board APIs if available

## How It Works Now

### First-Time User Flow:
1. User visits the site → redirected to `/login`
2. User clicks "Sign up" → fills registration form
3. Upon signup, JWT token is created and stored in localStorage
4. User is redirected to `/profile` to complete their profile
5. After profile creation, user can access all features

### Authentication Flow:
1. Login/Signup → JWT token stored in localStorage
2. Token includes user email and user_id
3. Protected routes check for token existence
4. All API calls use the logged-in user's ID
5. Logout clears localStorage and redirects to login

### Job Application Flow:
1. User scrapes jobs (or browses existing jobs)
2. Each job is stored in database with NLP analysis
3. User clicks "Apply" → creates application linked to their user_id
4. User profile data is used for generating cover letters
5. Applications are tracked per user in the dashboard

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database:
- SQLite database is created automatically
- Tables are created on first run
- Located at: `backend/job_automation.db`

## Important Notes

### Security:
- Change `SECRET_KEY` in `backend/app/core/config.py` for production
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- CORS is configured for localhost development

### Web Scraping:
- Indeed scraper uses basic HTTP requests (no API)
- May break if Indeed changes HTML structure
- Rate limiting: 2-second delay between requests
- For production, consider:
  - Using official job board APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed API)
  - Implementing proxy rotation
  - Adding error handling for structure changes

### User Experience:
- All emojis removed for professional appearance
- Clean login/signup pages
- User info displayed in navbar
- Protected routes prevent unauthorized access

## Database Schema

### Users Table:
- id, email, hashed_password, full_name, created_at

### User Profiles Table:
- Personal info (phone, address, city, state, zip)
- Professional info (skills, experience, job title, company, education)
- Resume and summary
- Links (LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio)
- Job preferences (desired titles, locations, salary, remote preference)

### Jobs Table:
- Job details from scraping
- NLP analysis results (match score, required skills, experience)

### Applications Table:
- Links users to jobs
- Tracks application status
- Stores cover letters and notes

## API Endpoints

### Authentication:
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Create new account
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

### Users:
- `POST /api/users/` - Create user
- `GET /api/users/{user_id}` - Get user
- `POST /api/users/{user_id}/profile` - Create/update profile
- `GET /api/users/{user_id}/profile` - Get profile

### Jobs:
- `GET /api/jobs/` - List all jobs
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}` - Get specific job
- `POST /api/jobs/` - Create job manually

### Scraper:
- `POST /api/scraper/scrape` - Background scraping
- `POST /api/scraper/scrape-sync` - Synchronous scraping

### Applications:
- `GET /api/applications/user/{user_id}` - Get user's applications
- `POST /api/applications/` - Create application
- `GET /api/applications/{user_id}/stats` - Get statistics

## Testing

To test the application:
1. Start backend: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
4. Sign up with a new account
5. Complete your profile
6. Scrape some jobs
7. Apply to jobs and track applications

## Future Improvements

1. **Email verification** for new accounts
2. **Password reset** functionality
3. **Job board APIs** instead of scraping
4. **Resume upload** and parsing
5. **Auto-apply** feature with customization
6. **Job alerts** via email
7. **Interview scheduling** tracker
8. **Application analytics** and insights
